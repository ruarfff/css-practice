# css-practice

Code following along with a css course I am doing.

## Workflow

This is just plain html and css. I am using the [live server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VS Code to view the html files.

You could also use something like [derver](https://github.com/AlexxNB/derver).
